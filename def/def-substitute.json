In the case of QUERY, however, it is an isolated or specific information request, rather than a broadly scoped scan or on-going check.  QUERY tends to be a simple retrieval of a value for a specific parameter, while SCAN implies a more thorough examination and identification of anomalies (relative to a known good state).
